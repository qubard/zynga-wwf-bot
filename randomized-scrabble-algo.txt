in O(n) time find all the valid squares for words (only needs to be done once)

Randomized algorithm for solving scrabble:

using a temporary board state:	
- randomly choose a valid square, randomly choose some i up to len(available_letters), choose a direction (up or down, left or right) randomly, and choose i letters
		- place them in the direction that was chosen
		- evaluate the new word from the (start) position to the (end) position's value
			- check if it's valid using a dictionary, and if the new words it makes are valid
		- keep track of the word if it increased the current max score (invalid words are 0), if not ignore it
		- Repeat

this algorithm runs in polynomial time
